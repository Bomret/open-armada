# Open Armada

An open-source engine for Star Trek: Armada (2000), built on Godot 4 with C#. It ships no game content: it reads the files of an Armada install the player owns.

Status: prototype. A model viewer loads ships and stations from the original `.sod` files with their textures.

## Requirements

- Godot 4.7 .NET build (`brew install --cask godot-mono`)
- .NET SDK 10 (pinned in `global.json`; the project targets `net8.0`)
- An installed copy of Star Trek: Armada

## Run the model viewer

```sh
dotnet build OpenArmada.csproj
godot-mono --path . -- --game "/path/to/Star Trek - Armada" --model Fente
```

`ARMADA_DIR` can replace `--game`. Drag to orbit, use the mouse wheel to zoom, Left/Right to step through models. `--screenshot out.png` renders one frame to a file and quits.

## Layout

- `src/Formats/` — parsers for the original file formats, plain C# without Godot dependencies.
- `src/Rendering/` — converts parsed data into Godot nodes.
- `src/Viewer/` — the model viewer scene script.
- `tools/SodCheck/` — parses every `.sod` in an install and reports failures:
  `dotnet run --project tools/SodCheck -- "/path/to/Star Trek - Armada/SOD"`

## SOD format notes

Version 1.8 follows the official Storm3D spec. The older versions were decoded from the shipped files:

| Version | Difference from 1.8 |
|---|---|
| 1.7 | Animation references have no time offset. |
| 1.6 | Also: a texture material table (name, texture, 7 unknown bytes) precedes the lighting materials; meshes carry one identifier that names a table entry. |
| 1.4, 1.5 | Also: no animation reference section. |
| 1.2 | Also: no animation sections. A mesh has one lighting material, counts in the order vertices/faces/texcoords, an unknown float, and faces with their own corner count. No cull byte. |
| 1.0 | Unsupported. Only `Wviracod.SOD` uses it, and the game does not reference it. |

The mesh trailer after the cull byte is a count followed by that many 16-bit vertex indices. The spec says the count is always 0; `Zentity.SOD` has 7.

Storm3D is left-handed. The builder mirrors Z and reverses triangle winding.
